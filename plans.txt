To make a commandogatchi, here is what is needed:

a. a menu to choose: continue / new / hall of fame
b. a commandogatchi with stats that can be check and reported on

****************************************************************
####1. Eggs####

Eggs that can hatch themselves into random monsters. A library or database of
monsters needs to be created.


####1.1 The commandogatchi:####

Has a hunger meter.
Has a happiness meter.
Has a health meter.
Has a growth meter.
Has a weight meter.
Has a discipline meter.

The commandogatchi will notify the user when it is in need of
attention. The user must respond correctly in order to care for
the commandogatchi.


***************************************************************

####2. Food####
Meals - fill up 1 hunger point.
Snacks - adds 1 happiness point and 2 weight points.


####3. Lights####
The lights need to be turned off when the commandogatchi is sleeping.


####4. Games####
Number guessing game.


####5. Medicine####
Administer medicine to the commandogatchi to cure sickness.
Commandogatchis can become sick if they poop and the user does
not clean the poop up for a long time.


####6. Bath####
Give a bath to the commandogatchi to clear its living area of waste.


####7. Information Card####
The information card will hold information about the commandogatchi's
- name
- age
- weight
- discipline level
- happiness level
- hunger level


####8. Discipline####
If the commandogatchi yells for attention for no reason, it must
be disciplined. Also, if the commandogatchi does not eat when the
user gives it food, it must be disciplined. The same is true if the
commandogatchi does not want to play games. Discipline it!


####9. Daemon####
Include some kind of daemon tool so that the commandogatchi can
notify the user that it is in need of attention.


####10. Victory / Failure####
If a user takes good care of their commandogatchi, it will grow into
an adult and fly away to its home planet.

If a user does not care for the commandogatchi, it will die.


####11. Scoreboard / Hall of Fame####
Keep record of all commandogatchi's that have lived, died, and 
flown away, along with all the interesting stats (stats like: How
many times did the commandogatchi poop? How many times did it
get sick? How many meals did it eat? And so on...
